Anyone is welcome to open link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/issues[issues] and/or pull-requests for bugfixes,
feature-requests and/or ideas. If unsure where to start we encourage you to open a
link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/discussions[discussion] topic first.

== Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to JReleaser are protected by a link:CLA.adoc[CLA]. Please read the document before making a contribution.
You'll be asked to digitally sign the document on your first contribution. Feel free to open a
link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/discussions[discussion] topic if you have questions.

== How to build

.Prerequisites
 - Java 11, up to 17.
 - Gradle 7.6.1. Use the provided `gradlew` script!

1. `git clone https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser.git`
2. `cd jreleaser`
3. `./gradlew build`

If you'd like to test out the Maven or Gradle plugins then you must install all dependencies into your local Maven
repository at least once:

`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`

From then on you just have to re-install those dependencies that changed, for example

`./gradlew :jreleaser-model:publishToMavenLocal` when changes were made to the `jreleaser-model` project.

IMPORTANT: The Gradle plugin responsible for building the Maven plugin descriptor is not that reliable. You'll have to
clean and regenerate the plugin descriptor on every change that modifies/affects the MOJO descriptors such as adding/removing
 parameters to a MOJO, that is
`./gradlew :jreleaser-maven-plugin:clean :jreleaser-maven-plugin:publishToMavenLocal --no-build-cache`.

TIP: You maye use link:https://github.com/kordamp/gm[] instead in which case the commands are shorter, for example
`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` becomes `gm install`.

=== Pull Request Process

 * Create an link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/issues[issue] outlining the fix or feature.
 * Fork the jreleaser repository to your own github account and clone it locally.
 * Hack on your changes.
 * Correctly format your commit message see <<commit-messages,>> below.
 * Make sure file headers are updated by running `./gradlew licenseFormat`.
 * Run a local build before committing, `./gradlew build -PspotbugsEnabled=true`.
 * Ensure that CI passes, if it fails, fix the failures.
 * Every pull request requires a review from the jreleaser subprojects MAINTAINERS.
 * If your pull request consists of more than one commit, please squash your commits as described in <<squash-commits,>>

=== Code Format

The project includes a `.editorconfig` file that defines code formatting options. Both checkstyle and spotbugs rules may
trigger when code does not conform to said rules.

Do not use `*` imports at all. Always use explicit imports.

[[commit-messages]]
=== Commit Messages

 * Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
 * Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
 * Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
 * When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title
 * We use link:https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/[Conventional Commits] for PR titles and commit messages.
 ** The following prefixes are allowed:
  - feat
  - fix
  - docs
  - style
  - refactor
  - perf
  - test
  - build
  - ci
  - chore
  - revert
  - i18n
  - deps

[[squash-commits]]
=== Squash Commits

Should your pull request consist of more than one commit (perhaps due to a change being requested during the review cycle), please perform a git squash once a reviewer has approved your pull request.

A squash can be performed as follows. Let's say you have the following commits:

```
initial commit
second commit
final commit
```

Run the command below with the number set to the total commits you wish to squash (in our case 3 commits):

```
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

You default text editor will then open up and you will see the following::

```
pick eb36612 initial commit
pick 9ac8968 second commit
pick a760569 final commit

# Rebase eb1429f..a760569 onto eb1429f (3 commands)
```

We want to rebase on top of our first commit, so we change the other two commits to `squash`:

```
pick eb36612 initial commit
squash 9ac8968 second commit
squash a760569 final commit
```

After this, should you wish to update your commit message to better summarise all of your pull request, run:

```
git commit --amend
```

You will then need to force push (assuming your initial commit(s) were posted to github):

```
git push origin your-branch --force
```

Alternatively, a core member can squash your commits within Github.

== Documentation

Documentation changes should be posted to link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser.github.io[jreleaser/jreleaser.github.io].
