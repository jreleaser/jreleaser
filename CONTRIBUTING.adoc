== How to build

.Prerequisites
Java 11.

1. `git clone https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser.git`
2. `cd jreleaser`
3. `./gradlew build`

If you'd like to test out the Maven or Gradle plugins then you must install all dependencies into your local Maven
repository at least once:

`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal`

From then on you just have to re-install those dependencies that changed, for example

`./gradlew :jreleaser-model:publishToMavenLocal` when changes were made to the `jreleaser-model` project.

IMPORTANT: The Gradle plugin responsible for building the Maven plugin descriptor is not that realiable. You'll have to
clean and regenerate the plugin descritptor on every change that modifies/affects the MOJO descriptors such as adding/removing
 parameters to a MOJO, that is
`./gradlew :jreleaser-maven-plugin:clean :jreleaser-maven-plugin:publishToMavenLocal --no-build-cache`.

TIP: You maye use link:https://github.com/kordamp/gm[] instead in which case the commands are shorter, for example
`./gradlew publishToMavenLocal` becomes `gm install`.
