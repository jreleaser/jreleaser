Release Java and non-Java projects quickly and easily with link:https://jreleaser.org[JReleaser]!

JReleaser is a release automation tool for Java and non-Java projects. Its goal is to simplify creating releases and
publishing artifacts to multiple package managers while providing customizable options.

For questions, support and general discussion, please use link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/discussions[GitHub Discussions].

== Install

There are multiple choices depending on your preference.

=== CLI
The CLI can be installed in the following ways:

*Homebrew* (only on OSX for now):

Requires Java 8
[source]
----
brew install jreleaser/tap/jreleaser
----

*Scoop*:

Requires Java 8
[source]
----
scoop bucket add jreleaser https://github.com/jreleaser/scoop-jreleaser.git
scoop install jreleaser
----

*Sdkman*:

Requires Java 8
[source]
----
sdk install jreleaser
----

*Jbang*

Requires Java 8
[source]
.stable
----
// Download, cache, and run
jbang jreleaser@jreleaser <command> [<args>]
----
[source]
.early-access
----
// Download, cache, and run
jbang jreleaser-snapshot@jreleaser <command> [<args>]
----

*Curl*

Requires Java 11
[source]
----
// Get the jreleaser downloader
curl -sL https://git.io/get-jreleaser > get_jreleaser.java

// Download JReleaser with version = <version>
// Change <version> to a tagged JReleaser release
// or leave it out to pull `latest`.
java get_jreleaser.java <version>

// Execute a JReleaser
java -jar jreleaser-cli.jar <command> [<args>]
----

*Manually*:

Download the pre-compiled binary from the link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/releases[releases page],
uncompress and copy to the desired location.

Be mindful that `jreleaser-{project-version}.zip` requires Java 8 to be installed while
`jreleaser-standalone-{project-version}-[linux|osx|windows].zip` can be used without a previous installation of Java as
it includes its own Java Runtime.

=== Docker
You can run JReleaser as a docker image, skipping the need to have a pre-installed Java runtime. You must mount the
working directory at the `/workspace` volume, for example assuming the current directory is the starting point:

[source]
----
$ docker run -it --rm -v `(pwd)`:/workspace \
  jreleaser/<image>:<tag> <command> [<args>]
----

Where image may be `jreleaser-slim`, `jreleaser-alpine`.

NOTE: The `jreleaser` command will be automatically executed inside `/workspace`.

You may also need to map environment variables to the container, such as `JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION`,
`JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN`, or others depending on your setup. Refer to the
link:https://jreleaser.org/guide/latest/configuration/environment.html[configuration] pages.

You can find the tag listing link:hub.docker.com/r/jreleaser/jreleaser-slim/tags[here].

=== Maven
Configure the jreleaser-maven-plugin in your POM file

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.pom.xml
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.jreleaser</groupId>
  <artifactId>jreleaser-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>{project-version}</version>
</plugin>
----

=== Gradle
Configure the jreleaser-gradle-plugin in your `build.gradle` or `settings.gradle` file

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
.build.gradle
----
plugins {
    id 'org.jreleaser' version '{project-version}'
}
----

=== Ant
Download the jreleaser-ant-tasks ZIP bundle from the
link:https://github.com/jreleaser/jreleaser/releases[releases page] and unzip it in your project. Place all JARs inside
the `lib` folder. Create this folder if there is none. Add the following elements to your `build.xml` file

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
.build.xml
----
<path id="jreleaser.classpath">
    <fileset dir="lib">
        <include name="jreleaser-ant-tasks-{project-version}/*.jar"/>
    </fileset>
</path>

<import>
  <javaresource name="org/jreleaser/ant/targets.xml"
                classpathref="jreleaser.classpath"/>
</import>
