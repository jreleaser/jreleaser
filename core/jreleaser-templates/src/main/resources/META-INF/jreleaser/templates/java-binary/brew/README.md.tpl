# Homebrew Formulas

## How do I install these formulae?
Invoke either of the following commands if the formula is hosted at GitHub

```sh
$ brew install {{repoOwner}}/tap/<formula>
```

Or

```sh
$ brew tap {{repoOwner}}/tap
$ brew install <formula>
```

Invoke the following command if the formula is *not* hosted at GitHub

```sh
brew tap {{repoOwner}}/homebrew-tap <git-clone-url>
brew install <formula>
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
