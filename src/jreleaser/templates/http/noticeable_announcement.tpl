JReleaser {{projectVersion}} is now available! This release brings the following features:

**Deploy:** Many updates to Maven deployers allowing for finer control on deployments to Maven Central, such as explicitly
defining PomChecker's `strict` mode, deploying WAR files and `klib` artifacts, snapshot URL normalization. Additionally,
deployers will check if target artifacts have already been deployed before uploading.
